Aspect Extraction using Dependency Analysis and Semantic Clustering
===============

This is my project for the CS 585 (Introduction to NLP) course, Fall '17, at UMass Amherst.

## Requirements

- The 5-Product Customer Review Dataset, provided [here](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#datasets).
- Python 3.6
- Various Libraries (for brevity, I have included a Conda environment YAML file)

## Instructions

### Parsing Raw Data

- Put the dataset in a folder outside the root folder.
- Modify the paths in `makeData.py` to match the path to the folder
- Run `makeData.py` to create the JSON files

### That's all for now, Folks!
